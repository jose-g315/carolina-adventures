        <h1>Development Process</h1>
        <p>The purpose of this website was to advetise Carolina Adventures to a wider audience. Visitors are able to <br> see what the company
        has to offer and also book their acitvity of choice. <br> <br>
        When planning out the website I wanted it to have a clear and consice layout throughout the whole site. <br>
        Each page has a similar layout with key differences such as color and minor layout modifications. <br>
        After having the layout I filled each page with content such as descriptions and multimedia. <br>
        The last step was to style the site using CSS to give it a better look.</p>
        <h1>Final Product Justification</h1>
        <p>Site wide I used the sans-serif faimly style to have a clear and easy to read font. <br>
        Each page utilized the use of white space to have plenty of room between sections and allow for <br>
        each page color to stand out. Also, the use of a navigation bar allowed visitors 
        to be able to move around the site as they wished. <br><br>
        Below is the justification for the final design of each page</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Index - The three offered activities are side by side which shows a picture and small description of the activity. <br>
                Each picture is clicklable and takes the user to that respective page.</li>
            <li>Hiking - This page lists the available trailrs in a list style. Each trail has a detailed description along with various pictures. <br>
                The layout of the page is clear and gives the user vital information of each trail such as difficulty level.</li>
            <li>Rafting - This page has the pictures of the activity close together to showcase the activity <br>
                 without the user having to look for them in various places.</li>
            <li>Horseback Riding - This page is different from the other actitivy pages as its layout is a grid of the avialble horses. <br>
                This was done to provide a clean presentation of all horses.</li>
            <li>Booking - The booking page had the most basic yet distinct layout and functionality out of the whole website. <br>
                The form is clear and consice and the page is devoid of the hero image to allow the user to concetrate on the form.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h1>Opportunities for Improvement and Growth</h1>
        <p>Overall I am very happy of my design and style choices for the website. <br>
            One area of improvement I would like to implement is a more complex color layout to the page. While my color choices were appropriate for the site <br>
            I do think I could have gone further to really make color a bigger part of the site. <br>
            Another area I would like to improve is to add more functionality. I did add javascript so that the header and footer are displayed in all pages <br> 
            while only being written once. I would like to expand this so that there is more complexity on the site.</p>
