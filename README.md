# Carolina Adventures

## Description
School project static website for an imaginary vacation company.
<br>
This site was made as a static front end site so there is no back end at this time.
<br>
This was my first extensive usage of HTML and CSS. There is a bit of JavaScript that added a functionality of choosing a random adventure.
